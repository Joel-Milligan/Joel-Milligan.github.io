            Starting as an intern, and later becoming a full developer, I spent the first 2 years working on Dynamics 365 and Power Apps platforms,
            with a later focus on full stack development with React, working on CBH's Corporate Website and Customer Portals.
            Delivered a multitude of projects of varying complexity, working personally with stakeholders and end users of the products I developed.
